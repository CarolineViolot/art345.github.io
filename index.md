Hello everybody ! This is a datastory about the movement #metoo. I wish Nicki Minaj can read this. I am really found of her. Please stay strong. Good bye everybody. By default, all blog posts will have buttons at the bottom of the post to allow people to share the current page on Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn. You can choose to enable/disable specific social media websites in the _config.yml file. You can also turn off the social media buttons on specific blog posts using social-share: false in the YAML front matter.
